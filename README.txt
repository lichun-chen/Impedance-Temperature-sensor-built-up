//This project is the Final version code used in Z_T_sensor
The Z_T_sensor is designed to monitor the impedance and temperature of mortar samples installed in the field environments. Several multiplers, a real-time colock, a SD card is embaded into this circuit to get the real-time reading of the field samples.
